# AnarchySpawn Plugin
**AnarchySpawn** is a Minecraft Folia 1.21.8 plugin that handles random spawning of players. When players first join or respawn without a bed/anchor, they will be randomly teleported to a safe location within a configurable radius from world coordinates 0,0.

## Features
- Random spawn locations within configurable radius.
- Safe spawn location detection.
- First-join random spawn.
- Random respawn when no bed or respawn anchor is set.
- Dimension restrictions: `/spawn` command cannot be used in the Nether or End.
- Configurable cooldown for the `/spawn` command to prevent abuse.
